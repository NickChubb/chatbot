Hi, my name is Nick and I am a recent graduate from Simon Fraser University with a BSc in Computer Science and Molecular Biology. During my time at university, I engaged in a diverse range of courses, combining my passion for computer science with molecular biology to develop a multidisciplinary skill set.

Over the last several years, I have worked in various internships and contract positions within the software industry. These experiences have not only enriched my academic knowledge but have also played a crucial role in shaping my professional identity. In particular, I have honed my front-end coding skills, specializing in TypeScript, React, Next.js, HTML, and CSS. My commitment to quality was evident during my internship as a Quality Assurance Engineer, where I solidified my foundation in Java, emphasizing the importance of precision and reliability in software development.

I consistently challenge myself through personal projects to reinforce and expand my software development skills. My dedication to continuous learning is reflected in my proactive approach to exploring new languages and frameworks. Currently, I am enrolled in an online Back-End Engineering course, a deliberate effort to refine the back-end skills I've cultivated over the years through personal projects. This course involves hands-on experience with JavaScript, Express, and PostgreSQL, equipping me to build scalable and robust backend infrastructure tailored for professional workplaces.

Beyond my academic and technical pursuits, I have actively participated in student politics, holding executive positions in various student unions. As the President of the Science Undergraduate Society and Applied Science Representative for the Simon Fraser Student Society, I successfully navigated diverse responsibilities, fostering strong leadership and communication skills. I am confident that these experiences will contribute significantly to my success as a software engineer, enabling me to collaborate effectively in team environments and communicate complex technical concepts with clarity and confidence.
