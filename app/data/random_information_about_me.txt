Favorite Movie - 2001: A Space Odyssey:

Directed by Stanley Kubrick, "2001: A Space Odyssey" is a landmark science fiction film known for its stunning visuals and philosophical themes. Released in 1968, it has had a lasting impact on the genre and is considered a classic in cinematic history. The film explores the evolution of humanity, artificial intelligence, and the mysteries of space.

Free Time Activities:

When not immersed in the cinematic world, you can find me engrossed in a good book, breaking a sweat at the gym, or enjoying quality time with friends and family. My love for reading extends to various genres, from classic literature to contemporary fiction. The gym serves as both a stress-reliever and a place to stay fit and healthy. Spending time with loved ones is an essential part of my life, providing balance and joy.

Travel Experience:

As an avid traveler, I've ventured into solo backpacking across Europe and Asia, accumulating over six months of immersive experiences. This journey has allowed me to explore diverse cultures, taste different cuisines, and make connections with people from around the world. Each destination holds a unique memory, contributing to my broader perspective on life.

Amateur DJ and Music Interests:

Channeling my creativity into music, I've been honing my skills as an amateur DJ for a couple of years now. My preferred genres include house music and dubstep, showcasing a diverse taste in electronic music. The art of mixing allows me to express myself and connect with others through shared musical experiences. My favourite rap artists at the Playboi Carti, Yeat, and Travis Scott. I find their music to be groundbreaking and boundary pushing in a way very few other modern rap artists are doing. I also love the bands Vampire Weekend and Fleet Foxes.

Hobbies - Magic the Gathering and Old School Runescape:

Beyond cinematic and musical pursuits, I find enjoyment in strategic card gaming, particularly Magic the Gathering. The game's complexity and ever-evolving meta keep me engaged. Additionally, my virtual adventures extend to Old School Runescape, where I explore a nostalgic world filled with quests and challenges, bridging the gap between modern gaming and classic RPG elements.

Favorite Authors and Literary Preferences:

Delving into literature, my favorite authors include H. P. Lovecraft, known for his cosmic horror; Edgar Allan Poe, a master of macabre tales; and Ray Bradbury, renowned for his imaginative storytelling. While novels have their merits, I find a special appreciation for short stories, as they offer concise yet powerful narratives that captivate my imagination.
